  description: "The Manila ACM SIGCHI Chapter (also known as CHI MNL) is an internationally recognized professional and research community in the Philippines, specializing in the field of human-computer interaction (HCI) research. <br><br>
        As a local chapter of the Association for Computing Machinery Special Interest Group on Computer Human Interaction (ACM SIGCHI), we provide venues for enriching discourse on all aspects of HCI research and practice, as well as access to both local and international HCI experts and organizations."

history:
  description: "In 2018, the idea of setting up a local chapter was initiated by the Filipino HCI researchers who attended CHI 2018 in Montreal, Canada. This was also the first time that more than one Filipino researcher participated in the premier conference for the field of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). After this meeting, founding members were recruited by reaching out to academics and students who are already doing HCI research, and UX practitioners. At the CHI 2019 conference in Glasgow, the Manila ACM SIGCHI Chapter was formally established. We were formally introduced to the other chapters during the Local Chapters Meeting and the Diversity and Inclusion Dinner."
