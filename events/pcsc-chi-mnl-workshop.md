        <h1>Call for Papers: Transforming HCI Research in the Philippines</h1>
        <br/>
        <h3>Date & Time: Half-day afternoon workshop, May 9, 2024</h3>
        <br/>
        <h3>Objective</h3>
        <p>The aim of this workshop is to catalyze and advance Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) research in the Philippines by fostering collaboration and knowledge exchange among researchers and practitioners. By bringing together diverse perspectives and experiences, we aim to explore innovative approaches and solutions to contemporary HCI challenges in the Philippine context. We invite early-career and experienced researchers alike who are interested in conducting HCI research in the Philippines. </p>
        <br/>
        <h3>Submissions</h3>
        <p>We invite submissions of works-in-progress, interactive demos, and position papers that contribute to the advancement of HCI research in the Philippines. Submissions should address, but are not limited to, the following topics:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Works-in-Progress:</b> ongoing research or projects exploring novel interface projects applicable in the Philippine setting, aiming to present preliminary findings and seek feedback for further refinement and development</li>
            <li><b>Interactive Demos:</b> showcase tangible implementations or prototypes of HCI-related technologies or systems, allowing participants to engage directly with the presented concepts, interfaces, or functionalities, fostering hands-on exploration and discussion during the workshop</li>
            <li><b>Pictorials:</b> Pictorials offer a unique opportunity for researchers, designers, and practitioners to present their work through visual narratives, rich images, and compelling illustrations. They provide a platform for conveying design processes, insights, and outcomes in a visually engaging manner. Whether showcasing prototypes, user studies, or design explorations, Pictorials enable contributors to communicate their work effectively, stimulate discussion, and inspire new ideas within the local HCI community. Submissions should adhere to the specified format guidelines and offer insights that complement the visual content, enhancing the overall understanding and impact of the presented work.</li>
            <li><b>Position Papers:</b> provide authors with an opportunity to articulate their viewpoints, perspectives, or arguments on specific issues, trends, or challenges within the realm of HCI research in the Philippines, aiming to stimulate discourse, debate, and collaboration among workshop participants</li>
        </ul>
        <br/>
        <h3>Submission Guidelines:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Abstract Length: 2-4 pages (excluding references)</li>
            <li>Format: ACM sigconf 2-column format following the PCSC template</li>
            <li>Language: English</li>
            <li>Submission Link: [Submission Link Here]</li>
            <li>Authors are requested to anonymize their submissions.</li>
        </ul>
        <br/>
        <h3>Selection Process</h3>
        <p>Juried submissions will undergo review by a committee, albeit through a less rigorous process compared to refereed submissions, and typically do not involve an author’s response or conditional acceptance. Unlike refereed content, juried submissions are not expected to make the same level of lasting and significant contributions to our knowledge and understanding. Authors can anticipate receiving light feedback, usually consisting of up to a few paragraphs in length.</p>
        <br/>
        <h3>Sample Submissions</h3>
        <p>Authors are invited to check out these submissions if they need help or inspiration regarding their submissions. </p>
